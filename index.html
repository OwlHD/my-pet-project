        <h1>Very Sleepy Animal</h1>
        <p>My dog loves to laze around the house.  If she isn't laying down next to you she can be found sitting outside in the sun,
            soaking in some rays and staying warm.

        <h2>Also Highly Energetic!</h2>
        <p>Thanks to all the sleeping, she usually has the energy to play all day!  My dog will go from laying down to running in circles
            at a moments notice, and loves to play fetch often.
